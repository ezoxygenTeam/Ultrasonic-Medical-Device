# The ultrasonic module system for medical device

Utilizing our innovative ultrasonic emitter, we've transformed traditional medical devices like blood pressure monitors, glucometers, thermometers, and scales into wireless-enabled health monitors. This innovation facilitates the real-time transfer of measurement data to smartphones without the need for complex WIFI or Bluetooth connections. Using the smartphone microphone is sufficient to receive the ultrasonic signals, simplifying the health monitoring process and making it more accessible and integrated for users.

# How to operate?

1. **Confirm Device Connection**: 
   - Make sure the medical device you want to measure is connected to our ultrasonic module.  
   (Note: The communication between the module and the medical device is through UART)

2. **Open the Android App or Activate the Smart Speaker**: 
   - Launch the Android app or activate your Smart Speaker. Smart Speakers can execute commands via voice.

3. **Audio Calibration**: 
   - Perform the initial audio calibration. This step is straightforward and takes only about 10 seconds.

4. **Select the Medical Device in the Menu**: 
   - After calibration, select the corresponding medical device from the menu.

5. **Start Measurement**: 
   - Click to begin measurement and start using your medical device (We use a blood pressure monitor for the following step instructions).

6. **Ultrasound Module Processing**: 
   - Once the measurement is complete, the ultrasonic module will begin to decode the values and emit ultrasonic signals.

7. **Data Reception on Smartphone**: 
   - After the smartphone receives the data, it displays measurements such as high blood pressure, low blood pressure, and heart rate. This completes the measurement and recording of blood pressure.

8. **Accessing and Monitoring Historical Data**: 
   - The data from the measurements can be accessed in the history section for long-term trend monitoring and analysis.

# Mobile Application Information

Now, our Android APK is compatible with both Android smartphones and Android TV.

**Note**:  
Android TV compatibility has been tested and confirmed on [Nvidia Shield TV](https://www.nvidia.com/zh-tw/shield/shield-tv-pro/). It can be used simply by connecting an external microphone.  

For the microphone part, our company offers high-specification USB microphones. If needed, please contact us for more details.

# Smart Speaker Information

On the smart speaker, we have implemented the Linxs system for development and paired it with Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) voice systems.  
This allows users to easily initiate data measurement tasks on the smart speaker using simple voice commands.
